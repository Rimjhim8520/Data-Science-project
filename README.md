 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

🏢 Internship: CodSoft  
*Internship Role:* Data Science Intern  
*Project Duration:* [01-07-2025 to 30-07-2025]  
*Task Number:* Task [5]

📌 Project Objective :

To analyze a dataset of credit card transactions and build a model to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques.

📂 Dataset :

Source: ["Provided by CodSoft"]
Features: Time, V1-V28 (PCA components), Amount, Class
Class: 0 = Non-Fraud, 1 = Fraud

🛠 Technologies Used :

 Python
 Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
 Scikit-learn
 Jupyter Notebook
 
📈 Tasks Performed :

1. Data Cleaning and Exploration
2. Feature Engineering
3. Data Visualization (Fraud vs Non-Fraud)
4. Handling Imbalance with SMOTE
5. Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
6. Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC Score

✅ Conclusion :

Built a fraud detection model with [insert accuracy] accuracy.
Observed clear differences in transaction amounts and PCA components between fraud and non-fraud cases.

🧠 Learnings :

 Handling imbalanced datasets
 Visualizing fraud patterns
 Model selection and evaluation
